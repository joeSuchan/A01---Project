Task: To creat your own personal multi-page website

Focus: Client-side HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Group Size: Typically, 2 developers per group (some groups may have 3). Work together, but each person will create their own content and 
submit separately.  Be original.  Do not copy and paste from others or reference code on the web. You are encouraged to start with h
ttp://www.initializr.com/ (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.. Do NOT use design templates (you may use Bootstrap). 

Create a new public* repository on GitHub. Under the repository settings, enable GitHub Pages* - this will automatically publish your index.html. 

1. Create a new folder (this will be the name of your repository). 
2. In this folder, create your personal website. Use the work that you have done in M01 and W01 and incorporate it into this new site. Use index.html for your opening page and add a css file for your style.
3. Include your profile photo (use img-circle to display it in a circle).
4. Include a second image - for example, as the background if you like. 
5. Include an an embedded video (e.g. a YouTube tutorial or NWMissouri video).
6. Use at least 15 different HTML tags, (e.g., html, head, body, title, br, p, a, div, span, ul, ol, li, img, link, form, input, button, header, footer, etc.)
7. Add at least 6 CSS selectors, 2 that style by element, 2 by id, and 2 by class. (More is fine.)
8. Include at least 3 pages: Home (index.html) / YourChoice (maybe the Tic-Tac-Toe game?) / Contact.
9. If you plan to use Tick-Tack-Toe Game the repo is available at https://github.com/profcase/web-tic-tac-toe (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.
10. Use a nicely styled Navbar (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/navbar/ (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.) - use Bootstrap or build your own from scratch. 
11. On your second page YourChoice, in a later assignment, you will use JavaScript to calculate something in response to user inputs. Suggestions include an online order form price calculation, calculation of the number of days since a user-provided date, calculation of the day of the week a user-entered date took place. The best ideas are ones you would actually use. Your idea should be unique - using similar calculations will result in a 10% score reduction (and as always, highly similar code may trigger an academic integrity violation). Draft your idea and a user input form here, but you don't have to make it work yet.  Later, you will calculate and display result(s) on your YourChoice page. 
12. On page 3, draft a contact form so users can say hello or ask you a question. (Again - it doesn't have to work yet.)
13. nclude links to your GitHub site, your BitBucket site, your LinkedIn account, and, if you wish, your Facebook or other social accounts. You can find official icons and images online.
14. Add a simple README.md file or README.txt to your folder (see GitHub public repos for examples).
15. workk with your partner, but submit separately. Your work must be creative - your pages must not be the same format or style as any other submission except your group partner, if you like. Test each other's website before finalizing your submissions. 
16.Validate your markup with https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site..
Title your post "NN Lastname, Firstname(s) - success" if successful, title your post "Lastname, Firstname" if you have questions.  List the ID and name for each of your group members in each of your submissions. Display all 3 of your pages in your submission.



Website has a simple layout, reason I did not go with a tic-tac-toe game becuase the directions say using simular calucations would result in a 10% decrease in grade and having a majortiy of the class do the game I wanted to avoid it.
